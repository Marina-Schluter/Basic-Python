## Structures and Control exercices

Here you will find exercises focus on control structures and string manipulation.

- **Exercise 1:** Write a program that prompts the user for a positive integer and displays whether the number is odd or even..
- **Exercise 2:** Write a program that prompts the user for a positive integer and displays all odd numbers from 1 to that number.
- **Exercise 3:** Write a program that prompts the user for a text string and displays on screen how many vowels the string contains.
- **Exercise 4:** Write a program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and displays the largest number in the list.
- **Exercise 5:** Write a program that generates a list of random numbers and displays on screen how many numbers are even and how many are odd.
- **Exercise 6:** Write a program that prompts the user for a text string and displays the same string inverted on the screen.
- **Exercise 7:** Write a program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and displays the sum of all the numbers in the list.
- **Exercise 8:** Write a program that prompts the user for a text string and displays on screen whether the string is a palindrome or not (i.e. whether it reads the same from left to right as from right to left).

## First basic Python exercices

This repository contains a series of Python exercises covering various topics. Below is a summary of the exercises and their solutions.

- **Exercise 1:** Calculate 7 raised to 4.
- **Exercise 2:** Split a string into a list.
- **Exercise 3:** Given certain variables, use the .format() method to print a particular string.
- **Exercise 4:** Given a concatenated list, get a specific string from it.
- **Exercise 5:** Given a concatenated dictionary, get a specific string from it.
- **Exercise 6:** Implement a function called domainGet that gets the domain of a user's email.
- **Exercise 7:** Implement a function called findDog, having as input a string, which returns True if that string contains the word 'dog' taking into account possible upper case.
- **Exercise 8:** Implement a function similar to the previous exercise, but this time count the number of occurrences of the string 'dog' in a certain input. 
- **Exercise 9:** Use lambda functions and the .filter() function to filter words from a list beginning with the letter 's'.
